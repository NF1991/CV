      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        An aspiring web developer with over 6 years worth of experience in
        customer service and administration, and more recently, an SEN teaching
        assistant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having dabbled with HTML and CSS in the past, I knew I always held a
        passion for web development, and working with various kinds of in-house
        software I always found myself wondering how they were created and how
        they could be improved, leading me to become very interested in how
        websites are made.

        language studies. On top of this, I really enjoy drawing using programs
        like Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint. I also participate in the
        village's weekly walking group.
